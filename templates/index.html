      <p class="text-gray-300">Bitcoin Data Intelligence was born from the need to go beyond basic charts. We wanted a platform that not only shows live Bitcoin prices but also offers data-driven interpretations, downloadable datasets, and predictions using real machine learning models. This dashboard empowers users—whether students, analysts, or investors—to explore patterns and extract value from raw data.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Problem We Noticed</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Most websites that show Bitcoin trends only display a simple line graph. They don't provide deeper insights, long-term context, or tools to interact with data. More importantly, we found that none allowed users to download data easily or apply predictions using their own logic.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Problem We Solve</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Our platform solves this by offering interactive visualizations, historical and live datasets, downloadable CSVs, and model-generated forecasts. This bridges the gap between raw crypto data and real-world analysis. It's built for education, research, and smart exploration.</p>
